# TinyTranslator

``
A tiny little webapp to quick and dirty translate XLIFF 2.0, XLIFF 1.2 or xmb/xtb files.
``

Did you start experimenting with the new `Angular 2` (or even 4) version?

And did you start experimenting with the new `i18n` features of Angular 2?

Then maybe this application is a tool for you.

For the impatient: Start it here
* [Tiny Translator (English)](https://martinroob.github.io/tiny-translator/en)
* [Tiny Translator (Deutsch)](https://martinroob.github.io/tiny-translator/de)
* [Tiny Translator (Google traduit Français)](https://martinroob.github.io/tiny-translator/fr-google)
* [Tiny Translator (Русский Google переведен)](https://martinroob.github.io/tiny-translator/ru-google)

This application can be used to work on the translation of all file formats Angular can use.
These are `XLIFF 2.0`, `XLIFF 1.2` or `XMB/XTB` files.

[[XLIFF 1.2]]((http://docs.oasis-open.org/xliff/xliff-core/xliff-core.html)) is an OASIS standard
and stands for <strong>XML Localization Interchange File Format</strong>.
So, as the name expresses, it is designed as a format to exchange localization informations
between different applications.
The standard is quite old, the specification of version 1.2 is from 2007.
And if you start to google for free tools, that support the format, 
you won´t find too many of them and they are all very old and seam to be a little bit out of date.

The Angular team decided, when they started working on i18n support for Angular 2, to use this format as the default for Angular.
The Angular i18n Cookbook 
[Internationalization (i18n)](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/i18n.html)
describes in detail, how to markup your templates and how to extract the i18n information using `ng-xi18n` (or Angular CLIs `ng xi18`).

You end up with a bunch of `.xlf` files that you shall send to a translator "<i>who fills in the translations using one of the many XLIFF file editors</i>". (citation from the cookbook).

<strong>TinyTranslator</strong> is just another one of these many editors.
It is a Web Application written with Angular (v4.1).
In short, you can open a `.xlf` file with it, it shows you all untranslated messages and lets you type in the translations.
When finished, you can reexport the file and use it in your application to generate a translated version of your app.

It is not intended as a tool for professional translators, that earn their money with doing translations.

The intendend user is a developer, who just has to quickly translate his application.

And, there is also a limitation to be mentioned:
>Tiny Translator does not understand everything, that is mentioned in the XLIFF 1.2 specification or in the XLIFF 2.0 specification.
So it is not conformant to the standard.
It can work with every xlf that is generated by ng-xi18n so far. Any features that are not used by ng-xi18n are not supported.
